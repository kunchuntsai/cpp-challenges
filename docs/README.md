# Algorithms Visualizations & Docs

This project provides interactive visualizations and code documentation for classic algorithms and data structures, with implementations in C, C++, and Python. The visualizations are designed to help you understand how algorithms work step by step, and the code links let you explore real implementations in multiple languages.

## Setup a localhost
To view the visualizations and documentation locally, run:
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/docs/](http://localhost:8000/docs/) to browse the site.

Website: https://kunchuntsai.github.io/cpp-challenges/

The website above is the public GitHub Pages deployment of this project. It contains the same visualizations and documentation as the local version, always up to date with the main branch.

Explore the docs to:
- See algorithm visualizations for 02.two_pointers, 15.greedy, and more
- Quickly access C, C++, and Python code for each algorithm
- Read notes and explanations for interview prep and learning
