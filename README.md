# C++ Challenges

## Circular Buffer
This challenge tests your ability to implement a data structure and manage memory efficiently. It requires understanding of array manipulation and possibly dynamic memory allocation.

## Simple Smart Pointer
This challenge focuses on memory management and modern C++ features. It tests your understanding of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), move semantics, and operator overloading.

## Thread-safe Singleton Logger
This challenge combines object-oriented design with concurrent programming. It tests your ability to implement the singleton pattern in a thread-safe manner and basic logging functionality.

## Thread Pool
Aspects of C++ programming tested in the thread pool implementation:
* Thread Management: Creating, joining, and detaching threads.
* Synchronization Primitives: Using mutexes, condition variables, and atomic operations.
* Task Queue Management: Implementing a thread-safe queue for tasks.
* Template Programming: For generic task types and result handling.
* Lambda Functions: Often used for worker thread functions.
* Smart Pointers: For managing dynamically allocated resources.
* RAII Principles: Ensuring proper resource cleanup.
* Move Semantics: For efficient task object handling.
* Exception Handling: Dealing with exceptions in multithreaded contexts.
* Standard Library Containers: Such as std::queue for the task queue.

This challenge is particularly relevant for positions involving high-performance or system-level programming, where understanding of concurrency and efficient resource utilization is crucial. It's also relevant to the job description you provided earlier, which mentions embedded software development and performance optimization.
