# C++ Challenges
This order allows for a gradual increase in difficulty, testing various aspects of C++ programming along the way. It starts with basic data structures and algorithms, progresses through memory management and design patterns, and culminates in advanced concurrency and system-level programming.

Keep in mind that the perceived difficulty can vary based on individual experience. For example, someone with strong concurrency experience might find the Thread Pool easier than the JSON Parser.

* Circular Buffer: This is a relatively straightforward data structure implementation, making it a good starting point.
* Trie (Prefix Tree): While it involves tree structures, the concept and implementation are generally straightforward.
* LRU Cache: This requires understanding of data structures and basic algorithms, but is still relatively manageable.
* Simple Smart Pointer: This introduces memory management and some modern C++ concepts, increasing the difficulty slightly.
* Thread-Safe Singleton Logger: This brings in basic concurrency and design patterns, stepping up the complexity.
* Generic Observable Pattern: This challenge tests understanding of templates and design patterns, which can be tricky.
* Thread-Safe Queue: This further tests concurrency knowledge, focusing on synchronization primitives.
* JSON Parser: Parsing involves more complex string manipulation and recursive logic, increasing the difficulty.
* Memory Pool Allocator: This requires deep understanding of memory management and low-level optimizations.
* Thread Pool: This is the most complex, combining advanced concurrency, templates, and careful resource management.

# Description
This repository contains a collection of C++ challenges that cover various aspects of C++ programming. Each challenge is designed to test different skills and concepts in C++.

## Circular Buffer
This challenge tests your ability to implement a data structure and manage memory efficiently. It requires understanding of array manipulation and possibly dynamic memory allocation.

## Simple Smart Pointer
This challenge focuses on memory management and modern C++ features. It tests your understanding of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), move semantics, and operator overloading.

## Thread-safe Singleton Logger
This challenge combines object-oriented design with concurrent programming. It tests your ability to implement the singleton pattern in a thread-safe manner and basic logging functionality.

## Thread Pool
Aspects of C++ programming tested in the thread pool implementation:
* Thread Management: Creating, joining, and detaching threads.
* Synchronization Primitives: Using mutexes, condition variables, and atomic operations.
* Task Queue Management: Implementing a thread-safe queue for tasks.
* Template Programming: For generic task types and result handling.
* Lambda Functions: Often used for worker thread functions.
* Smart Pointers: For managing dynamically allocated resources.
* RAII Principles: Ensuring proper resource cleanup.
* Move Semantics: For efficient task object handling.
* Exception Handling: Dealing with exceptions in multithreaded contexts.
* Standard Library Containers: Such as std::queue for the task queue.

This challenge is particularly relevant for positions involving high-performance or system-level programming, where understanding of concurrency and efficient resource utilization is crucial. It's also relevant to the job description you provided earlier, which mentions embedded software development and performance optimization.
