## Setup Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies: (for the first time)
   ```bash
   pip install -r src/python/requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: If you get "command not found: pip", use `pip3` instead. This is common on systems where Python 3 is installed alongside Python 2.

3. Run a solution:
   ```bash
   python3 arrays_hashing/two_sum.py
   ```
